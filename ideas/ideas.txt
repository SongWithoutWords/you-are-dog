dog stealth game

Player goal is to get food in a restaurant without anyone noticing that you are a dog.

Game phases:
BEGIN:			A level starts by walking into a restaurant. A bell dings. The restaurant is RELAXED.
RELAXED:		While RELAXED, collaborators will feed you if you are near them. This generates attention.
ALERT:			Too much attention will cause the waiters to enter an ALERT state.
				At this point they will begin to walk towards the player.
AWARE:			If the player gets too close to a waiter during the ALERT phase, they will figure out that you are a dog and become AWARE.
				At this point one waiter will attempt to get to the phone to call animal control, while the others will attempt to corner you.
ESCAPE:			After a waiter calls animal control, a dog catcher shows up, and the ESCAPE phase begins.
				At this point the player must flee the restaurant while avoiding the dog catcher.
